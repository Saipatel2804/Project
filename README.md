This article utilizes the MATLAB SIMULINK platform to simulate a 3.25 kWP grid-connected 
single-stage solar photovoltaic system. The system includes a multilevel inverter and takes into 
account real-time meteorological conditions. The use of a DC-DC converter is entirely 
disregarded in favor of a multilayer inverter, which ensures voltage stability, tracks the 
maximum power point, and converts DC to AC. There is a five-level multilevel inverter that has 
five switches; to add two more levels to the result voltage waveform, simply add another switch. 
The result of the 1-level inverter is mixed with the 1-level, 230V, 50 Hz grid supply. The only 
purpose of a shunt active current controller is to limit the system to actual power flow. The 
inverter is controlled utilizing a multi transporter sinusoidal heartbeat width regulation 
framework, and the overall harmonic distortion of the output voltage is just 1.18% up to the 
100th harmonic content, which is very low. Daily energy production from a grid-connected 
conventional inverter verifies the simulated findings. The proposed work is in good agreement 
with existing empirical evidence, and it improves power quality.
